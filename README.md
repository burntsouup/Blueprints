# Blueprints

## _Blueprints is my tribute to my journey as a Civil Engineer._ _From a young age, I was captivated by building and creating with Lego.  This passion, combined with a natural aptitude for math, led me to pursue a degree in Structural Engineering.  Though my career in this field was brief, I cherished the opportunity to delve into and apply its theoretical principles.  Over time, I've come to deeply appreciate the structural integrity that engineers imbue into every edifice around us._ _Blueprints is a reflection of my admiration for my past profession. It explores the concept that every structure begins with a blueprint - a detailed plan to achieve a specific goal.  This idea resonates with me as a metaphor for life itself.  Our personal blueprints may be imperfect and subject to change, but they provide a foundational guide for our aspirations and achievements._
