# Blueprints

## _Blueprints is my tribute to my journey as a Civil Engineer.  

From a young age, I was captivated by building and creating with Lego.  This passion, combined with a natural aptitude for math, led me to pursue a degree in Structural Engineering.  Though my career in this field was brief, I cherished the opportunity to delve into and apply its theoretical principles.  Over time, I've come to deeply appreciate the structural integrity that engineers imbue into every edifice around us.

Blueprints is a reflection of my admiration for my past profession. It explores the concept that every structure begins with a blueprint - a detailed plan to achieve a specific goal.  This idea resonates with me as a metaphor for life itself.  Our personal blueprints may be imperfect and subject to change, but they provide a foundational guide for our aspirations and achievements._
